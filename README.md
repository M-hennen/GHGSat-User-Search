# GHGSat-data-search
 GUI Tool for searching GHGSat data

 This python tool launches a tkinter GUI for users to search the GHGSat Methane observation data accessible from the UKRI Methane monitoring project. 
 
 To gain access to the data, please contact Satellite Applications catapult https://sa.catapult.org.uk/projects/methane-monitoring/

 Once you have bulk downloaded the emission data from the Spectra Portal, you can filter through these data using this tool. 

 This tool allows you to search the data by a given location (WGS84 decimal degrees), identifying all availble data within a spatial buffer which you define. 

 Users can also define a date range from which to search. 

 All availbile data which meet the criteria will be saved in a seperate folder, which is difined by the user.
